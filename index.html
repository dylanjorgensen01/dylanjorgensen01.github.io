					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
					I am currently a senior at the University of South Carolina majoring in Biological Sciences and minoring in Criminal Justice and Psychology. At the University of South Carolina, I have been involved in Tri Beta, Phi Kappa Tau, and Capstone scholars. Tri Beta is a national honors society for biology majors and have been able to make multiple connections with professionals in the biology field. Within Phi Kappa Tau, I have helped organize community service events and have been able to make lifelong connections. Capstone Scholars has also allowed me to participate in community service and grow as a young professional throughout my college career.

					Outside of school, I am the middle of 3 children from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When I am at home I enjoy multiple hobbies including: snowboarding, camping, and playing sports. Once a year my whole extended family goes on a camping trip to Salt Fork, Ohio. At the campgrounds, I enjoy water skiing, tubing, hiking, and spending time with my family. In addition, I love to go out and play either rugby or spikeball with friends whenever there is nice weather.

					<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
					<p>
					Throughout my college career, I have had multiple oppurtunities that have led to my future career goal in clinical research within the pharmaceutical industry. First, I had the oppurtunity to become a Teaching Assistant for the Organic Chemistry Labs. In this role, I was able to develop my laboratory practices and teach other undergraduate students about Organic Chemistry techniques. In addition, I had the oppurtunity to intern at a Pharmaceutical market research company during the summer of my junior year. At this internship, I was able to develop an expertise in current research happening in the gastroenterology field.
					</p>
					<p id="futureMoreInfo" class="hidden">
					With these experiences, I plan to obtain a position in clinical research within the pharmaceutical industry. Through the internship and teaching assistant position, I was able to develop a passion for research that I plan to continue. I am currently trying to obtain internships more specific to the clinical research field so I can confirm this passion before going to graduate school. I am looking forward to graduation and seeing where my future endeavors take me.
